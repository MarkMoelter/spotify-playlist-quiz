# Spotify Song Quiz

This application uses Spotify's API to quiz users on song names, artists in their playlists.

The user logs into their spotify account, selects the number of questions,
and the playlist they want to be quizzed on.

## Each question works as follows:

1) Listen to a 15-30 second audio clip from a randomly selected song in their playlist
2) Guess the song played from 4 choices, 3 of the choices will be randomly selected from the playlist
